Premise

The game opens with you, our brave adventurer, standing in a village engulfed in chaos.  
You are recruited by a mysterious figure named The Weaver to save the village.  Or are 
you?  You must face five different entities, some human, some not, known collectively 
as The Puzzlemasters and you must solve their challenges to progress.  What awaits you 
at the end?  Salvation for the village? Or something else?

**************************************************************************************

Gameplay

The game begins with a storyline presented to the player in small chunks that the 
player progresses through by typing anything on the screen and pressing enter.  Advancing
through the puzzles does not necessarily require the player to read the storyline (they 
can skip through until they reach a puzzle if they so choose) but there are clues to 
some puzzles in the narration that would otherwise make it difficult for the player to
solve.  For example, advancing to the first puzzle references the 1001 paths.  The first
puzzle is a binary search tree and the winning number is 1001.

Puzzles

The game features five unique puzzles, one for each room.  Solving each puzzle allows
the player to progress to the next room and continue their adventure.

Scoring

The game features a scoring system based on the system clock that begins with a base
score and gradually ticks down so the player should be motivated to progress quickly.

Map

The game features a map that provides coordinates and location data for players.

Congratulations!

Upon successful completion of the game, the player is rewarded with a hearty scrolling 
congratulatory message!
